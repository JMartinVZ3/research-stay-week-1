## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that empowers computers to learn patterns and make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed. In this course, we will delve into one of the exciting applications of machine learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, making it an essential component in various AI applications.
